 This demo requires the GL_ARB_texture_cube_map extension 
(GeForce, GeForce2, etc) and multitexture.

 If you've got RedHat6.2 with the Mesa development environment and NVIDIA
0.9x drivers (XFree4.0) installed correctly, typing 'make' should do everything 
required. After building, cd to the src directory and run 'mba_nvdemo'.

 If you're  using Windows, you have two build options: 
cd to the src directory and type 'nmake -f Makefile.WIN32' for a command line 
build, or open ENVMAP.dsp in VC++6. I used 'tmake' to generate these files - 
if you're into cross-platform development, I highly recommend you check it out:

 It is recommended to run this demo at 24bpp, otherwise the stencil
buffer will be disabled (stencil buffer is not hardware accelerated at
16bpp). Witb the stencil buffer disabled, things will look funky when viewed
from outside the room walls.

Command Line
------------
-timer x  : x  = number of milliseconds to pass to glutTimerFunc. 
            0  = run as fast as possible
			33 = max fps approx. 30 fps
			16 = max fps approx. 60 fps (default)

Keyboard
--------
'='     : increase viewing gamma by 0.1
'-'     : decrease viewing gamma by 0.1
'0'     : reset viewing gamma to 1.0
<space> : toggle animation
<tab>   : toggle fullscreen
'c'     : reset camera transform
'q'     : quit
<esc>   : quit
